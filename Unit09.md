**Unit 9: Challenges and Reflections** <span id="9"></span> 
*As industrialization continues to spread throughout the Middle East and
Asia, our terminology may shift to refer to the North/South hemispheric
split rather than the East/West division. The most important
technological developments today have global reach; consider computers
and the Internet. The more tentative union of science and technology
that emerged in the 19<sup>th</sup> century is now a tighter amalgam
that some call technoscience. Technoscience refers to experimentation
that requires massive technological infrastructure, such as scientific
research conducted in space. Notwithstanding these advancements,
criticism of technological progress has become more organized and
professional, especially in the fields of biotech, nuclear power,
energy, and environmental studies.*  
    
 *This unit provides a snapshot of technology in the present day, paying
particular attention to energy, medicine, and computers. Complex
socio-technical systems (networks of humans, machines, and institutions)
are quite obvious in these fields. These topics also underscore how
certain technologies have become global matters today that raise ethical
and philosophical questions concerning the environment, human and civil
rights, and humanity in general. Science and Technology Studies (STS)
offers new perspectives on technology, such as feminist approaches and
Actor-Network Theory.*

     Instructions: In prior units, we have used the concept of
    *socio-technical system* to explain technology in society (subunit
    7.5). Now, we will introduce a more recent theory, developed
    especially by philosopher Bruno Latour. His Actor-Network Theory
    (ANT) is one way to avoid the twin extremes of technological
    determinism (see subunit 3.1.3) and social constructivism, or the
    notion that social forces drive all technological changes. Latour
    does not believe that technologies and other “non-human actors” are
    fundamentally distinct from humans and society. As you will see in
    this reading, a “network” unites human and non-human actors. Click
    on the link above to access this introduction to ANT. You should
    leave the reading with a basic idea of what ANT is, based on
    concrete examples.
