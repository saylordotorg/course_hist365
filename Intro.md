This course provides an introduction to the history of technology for
the Science, Technology, and Society (STS) major.  The course surveys
major technological developments from ancient to modern times with
particular attention to social, political, and cultural contexts in
Europe and the United States.  You will also think critically about the
theory of technological determinism, the ways in which technology has
defined “progress” and “civilization”, and the major ethical
considerations surrounding today’s technological decisions. This course
begins with discussions of the promotion of technology in centralized
states of the ancient and medieval worlds: the Roman Empire, Song and
Ming China, and the Islamic Abbasid Empire.  After a period of relative
decline, the states of Western Europe centralized and flourished once
again, having benefited from the westward transmission of key ideas and
technologies from the East. The focus of the course then shifts to the
West, to the technologies of the Renaissance in Italy,
industrialization, imperialism, and World War I.  Unbounded faith in
technology, which was characteristic of the 19<sup>th </sup>century,
suffered a severe blow after two industrial world wars.  Today, many
nations that are interested in technological solutions to social,
medical, and military problems also value a healthy environment and
respect human and civil rights.

### Course Information

Welcome to STS203.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.  
  
 **Course Designer**: Warren Dym, Ph.D.  
    
 **Primary Resources**: This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes significant use of
the following materials:  

-   The Open University’s *[History of Science, Technology, and
    Medicine](http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/history-science-technology-and-medicine)*
-   [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/)
-   Dr. Steven Kreis’ *[The History
    Guide](http://www.historyguide.org/index.html)*
-   Fordham University’s *[Internet Modern History
    Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/mod/modsbook.asp)*

**Requirements for Completion**: In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 You will also need to complete assessments for each unit and the Final
Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the resources and assessments in each unit of the course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment**: This course should take you a total of **128
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take 8.5 hours to complete. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunit 1.1 and sub-subunit 1.2.1 (a total of 4.5 hours) on Monday
night; sub-subunits 1.2.2 through 1.2.4 (a total of 4 hours) on Tuesday
night; etc.
