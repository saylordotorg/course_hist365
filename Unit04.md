**Unit 4: Renaissance Technology** <span id="4"></span> 
*The Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci once designed movable
barricades to help protect the city of Venice and planned to literally
move the Arno River. Da Vinci was one of the greatest engineers of all
time. It was the Renaissance that made a fine art out of lowly crafts
such as painting and machine building, which were previously confined to
the workshop and pursued by anonymous craftsmen. Prior to Da Vinci’s
day, few scholars would have dirtied their hands with painting, mining,
masonry, and applied mathematics like machine building or surveying.
However, as northern Italian princes consolidated power and larger
states across Europe – Spain, France, England – centralized, scholars at
the service of the state increasingly offered technological solutions to
their patrons’ military and natural resource problems.*  
    
 *This unit studies the Renaissance period (roughly the
15<sup>th</sup>-16<sup>th</sup> centuries) because of its significance
in the history of technology. You will be introduced to the Gutenberg
press and its role in spreading technological knowledge, as well as the
impressive engineering feats of the leading architects who recovered
Greco-Roman traditions. Even more, this unit discusses early gunpowder
technologies in the West, such as the use of muskets and cannons. Only
the largest, most centralized states could adopt these new technologies
on a grand scale, whether on the battlefield or on voyages of discovery.
While completing this unit, think critically about the extent to which
print and gunpowder technologies determined cultural and political
developments and also about the ways cultural and political conditions,
by contrast, steered technological developments.   *

    The Florence Cathedral has a Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance
    history. The distinctively Renaissance component is the massive dome
    (*Duomo*) on top. This was one of the greatest engineering feats of
    its time. The artist-engineer was Felipe Brunelleschi, and this
    short lecture explains how he found inspiration in the Pantheon
    (Unit 1) and imagined novel technical solutions for this monumental
    challenge.

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the entire text. Be
    sure to click on the hand icon at the end of each webpage to read
    all three sections on the Military Revolution. Another example of
    technological determinism is the theory that changes in warfare –
    especially tactics and the spread of gunpowder technologies like
    muskets and cannons – led to massive state centralization throughout
    Europe. This reading presents evidence for this theory, tying new
    technology to political development. After reading, take some time
    to construct a definition of the Military Revolution. The reading
    below in subunit 4.5.2 will provide a necessary correction to this
    theory.  
      
     Reading, note-taking, and defining the Military Revolution should
    take approximately 3 hours.
