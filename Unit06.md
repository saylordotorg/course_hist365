**Unit 6: Technology and Imperialism** <span id="6"></span> 
*The 19<sup>th</sup> century is often referred to as the Age of Progress
because of the many benefits derived from industrial production.
However, it is necessary to think more critically about the notion of
progress as being intimately tied to imperialism and contemporary
theories of civilization. During the 19<sup>th</sup> and early
20<sup>th</sup> centuries, industrializing nations competed for natural
resources and labor across the globe. Sentiments of nationalism, social
Darwinism, and racial science drove the competition. Technology was at
the center of this civilizing mission, both as the means through which
imperial nations pacified subject populations and how they measured
civilization itself. They ranked civilizations according to relative
levels of science and technology on an imagined hierarchy of
development, in which white Europeans usually appeared on top.*  
    
 *This unit will complicate your understanding of* progress* and*
civilization *in Western history. It will illustrate how cutting-edge
industrial technologies like telegraphy, steamboats, trains, and machine
guns served imperial interests. We will focus especially on Britain in
India and Africa, and American expansion westward and into the Pacific.*

**6.1.1 Anthropological Theories** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: University of Alabama’s Department of Anthropology:
    Heather Long and Kelly Chakov’s “Social Evolutionism”**
    Link: University of Alabama’s Department of Anthropology: Heather
    Long and Kelly Chakov’s [“Social
    Evolutionism”](http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Social%20Evolutionism) (HTML)  
                            
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the “Basic
    Premises” and “Points of Reaction” sections. Early anthropologists
    ranked the peoples of the world and introduced terms such as
    “savage” and “civilization” that contemporary imperialists easily
    co-opted. Notice how central technological developments were to
    Lewis Henry Morgan’s theory in particular, and study his three
    stages of evolution.
