**Unit 3: The Not-So-Dark Ages** <span id="3"></span> 
*Scholars of the Renaissance Movement were the first to describe their
medieval predecessors as living in a “dark age” of cultural
impoverishment. These humanists believed that Christian theologians had
neglected much Greco-Roman (pagan) learning and privileged impractical
disciplines like theology and logic. But this was a harsh judgment,
considering their interest in Roman law, the technological interests of
monks, and innovative Cathedral building of the late medieval period.
Indeed, a veritable agricultural revolution was underway in the North.
Horses and plows boosted production, and the population boom that ensued
was only checked by the onset of the Great Plague in 1348. In this unit,
you will see that the medieval period was anything but dark – what
defined the gothic Cathedral better than light?*  
    
 *This unit will challenge the popular conception that the medieval West
was a “dark” age. You will explore the agricultural innovations behind
the feudal social structure, women’s work, Cathedral building, and the
general rebound in Western Civilization, which occurred during the
height of Roman Catholic power in Europe. *

    read “Agricultural Tools,” “The Harnessing of Time,” and “Weaving
    and the Textile Industry.” Feel free to explore any embedded links.
    Again, notice the important social contexts and implications of new

**3.1.3 The Stirrup Controversy** <span id="3.1.3"></span>

    Link: Engines of Our Ingenuity: John H. Lienhard’s
    [“Stirrups”](http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi476.htm) (HTML or M3U)  
        
     Instructions: Technological determinism is the theory – now mostly
    discredited – that technologies shape human history by making
    particular developments inevitable. For example, some have argued
    that the introduction of the stirrup in European history was the
    cause of the feudal social structure. Read this short account of the
    most popular expression of the theory, that of historian Lynn White.
    Note that you may also click on the link available on the webpage to
    listen to the episode. The reading below will take issue with this
    theory.  
        
     Reading and note-taking should take about 15 minutes.

    Warfare”](http://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/Significance+of+the+Stirrup+in+Medieval+Warfare) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the entire essay.
    The essay discusses the shortcomings of Lynn White’s stirrup thesis
    and offers an alternative theory for the importance of mounted
    cavalry in medieval warfare. Based on what you have learned from
    this reading, write a brief explanation of why White’s theory is
    weak.  
        
     Reading, note-taking, and writing the explanation should take
    approximately 2 hours.

    and Craft Production”**

    Craft
    Production”](http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth200/artist/guilds.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above, read this account of the
    guild, and take notes on its economic functions. Also, note the role
    that women had in the workshop. Cennini’s *The Craftsman Handbook,*
    the source at the bottom of the webpage, shows how craft skill was
    becoming something more than a lowly enterprise in the Renaissance
    and in some ways akin to the liberal arts (Unit 4). Historians
    distinguish between primary and secondary sources. Secondary sources
    are the articles, textbooks, and other more contemporary writings
    generated by historians themselves about events of the past. A
    primary source dates to a specific historical moment, such as an
    ancient Roman legal code, the correspondence between a medieval King
    and his advisors, a schoolbook of the nineteenth century, or even an
    anonymous diary of the early twentieth century. Cennini’s *The
    Craftsman Handbook* is a primary source. As you read this piece,
    think about what makes this a primary source and why they are more
    challenging to read than secondary sources.  
        
     Reading and note-taking, and considering the reading as a primary
    source should take approximately 3 hours.

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and scroll down to read the
    section “Urban Working Women.” This provides a more focused look at
    women’s work and how it compared to men’s work during the Middle
    Ages. Also, notice how the guild structure served to lower the
    status of women in society.  
      
     Reading and note-taking should take approximately 15 minutes.
