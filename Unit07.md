**Unit 7: Second Industrial Revolution** <span id="7"></span> 
*The first Industrial Revolution in Britain centered on cotton, steam,
and iron production (Unit 5). Nations that were turning to
industrialization in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, such as Germany, the
United States, Japan, and Russia, followed the British example. However,
by the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, a new model of technological
development eventually rendered the British model obsolete. This new
model was the so-called Second Industrial Revolution, which was driven
by steel, petroleum, electricity, and chemical production.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn about the defining features of the Second
Industrial Revolution, the industrial application of scientific
research, the first socio-technical systems – a handy way to refer to
networks of humans, machines, and institutions such as the telephone or
car industries *–* and the electrification of the household, which was a
revolution that particularly affected women. Rather than isolating one
or another invention from this period – for example, the light bulb or
internal combustion engine – you will look at the rich social and
cultural contexts of industry innovations.*
