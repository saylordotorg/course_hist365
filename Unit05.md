**Unit 5: New Science and Industrialization** <span id="5"></span> 
*Historians typically present the Scientific Revolution (sixteenth
through seventeenth centuries) as a major theoretical achievement, and
present the Industrial Revolution (late 18th and early 19th centuries)
as primarily a technological accomplishment. In actuality, contributors
to the Scientific Revolution like Galileo and Robert Boyle worked hard
to spread interest in craft knowledge; leaders of the Industrial
Revolution, such as James Watt, were served well by their knowledge of
mechanical theory.  *  
    
 *This unit continues our analysis of craft knowledge by showing how
Galileo, a mathematician and instrument-maker, struggled to find higher
status for these ‘hands-on’ activities. Others of the Scientific
Revolution also sought to undermine the ancient distinction between
scholars and craftsmen. You will then turn to the Industrial Revolution
in England, focusing on the replacement of muscle power with machines in
the cotton industry, the spread of steam power, and the spike in iron
production. This complex of technological change would impact mainland
Europe and beyond, promoting an industrial society that became
characteristic of the 19<sup>th </sup>century Western world and beyond.
The United States provides a useful case of the adoption of industrial
methods and appropriation into new forms. One example was a new system
of production in the U.S.: interchangeable parts.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the brief webpage.
    It is important to see that Galileo’s conflict with the Catholic
    Church was more about authority than a battle between science and
    religion, as it is often characterized today. This short passage on
    the Collegio Romano is a reminder that the Jesuits were leaders in
    mathematics and that Galileo owed a huge debt to their work.

     Instructions: Watch this lecture. One important achievement of the
    Scientific Revolution was to replace the medieval conception of
    motion (built especially on Aristotle and Ptolemy) with
    mathematically precise laws of motion. Key names behind this
    endeavor were Galileo, Kepler, Boyle, Descartes, and Newton. As you
    watch, take notes on the work of Boyle, Kepler, and Newton in
    particular. You should be able to explain Newton’s law of gravity.  
      
     Watching this lecture, taking notes, and explaining the law of
    gravity should take approximately 1 hour.
