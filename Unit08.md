**Unit 8: World War and Superpowers** <span id="8"></span> 
*Since your introduction to the Scientific Revolution (Unit 5), you have
witnessed a powerful synthesis of industrialization, nationalism, social
Darwinism, and imperialism. In this unit, you will learn about the two
world wars that marked the end of unbounded faith in these developments
and the beginning of a more critical approach to technological
progress.*  
    
 *This unit presents World War I as a showcase of cutting-edge
technologies and applied sciences of the period – metallurgical,
chemical, and medical. It explains the profound cultural consequences of
this war and how disenchantment in technological progress fueled
anti-Western sentiment in Russia, which contributed to the Soviet
takeover. In addition, you will learn about the dangerous competition
between the United States and the Soviet Union that followed World War
II. This period had great implications for the history of technology,
especially in nuclear weaponry and space exploration. Also in this unit,
you will take a close look at World War II technologies such as the
atomic bomb, which in turn sparked the Cold War.*
