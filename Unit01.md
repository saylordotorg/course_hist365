**Unit 1: The Ancient World** <span id="1"></span> 
*The popular statement “all roads lead to Rome” recalls a time when Rome
controlled vast lands and peoples surrounding the entire Mediterranean.
During that period, the Romans had the engineering wherewithal and slave
labor to pave an enormous road system around the capital city. If the
ancient Greeks were most famous for their science and philosophy, then
the Romans were masters of technology. Remnants of their feats – the
road system, irrigation systems, and large structures like the Pantheon
– are still visible today. Most of these relate back to the imperial
centuries, approximately between 27BC at the end of the Republic and
476AD when the first Germanic king of Rome became ruler. Roman history
exemplifies how massive centralized states promoted technological
advancement in the pre-modern world yet separated theoretical and
scientific studies from technology and craft knowledge. This split
between science and technology endured until the applied sciences of the
19<sup>th </sup>century (Unit 7), although some argue it continued to
the present day (Unit 9).*  
    
 *In this unit, you will learn how Greek philosophers distinguished
theory (episteme) from hands-on craft knowledge (techne), a social and
intellectual distinction with long-term implications in Western history.
You will then study the Roman Empire through its material forms
including water engineering, mining, and construction. Much of this
engineering legacy was lost to the West after the decline of the Empire
but recovered during the Renaissance Movement (Unit 4) and Scientific
Revolution (Unit 5).*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

**1.1 Greek Philosophy: Episteme and Techne** <span id="1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Richard Parry’s
    “Episteme and Techne”**
    Link: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Richard Parry’s
    [“Episteme and
    Techne”](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/episteme-techne/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the introduction
    and sections on Aristotle and Plotinus. This reading will introduce
    you to how ancient philosophers distinguished “theory” and
    “practice.” Note how Plotinus upheld theoretical knowledge
    (*episteme*) above the practical (*techne*) to an extent beyond
    Aristotle’s formulation. Theoretical knowledge would have higher
    status than craft knowledge in the medieval West (Unit 3).  
        
     Reading and note-taking should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and select the links to read
    the following sections: “Introduction,” “Roman Concrete,” “Roads and
    Highways,” “Bridges,” and “Water Supply Systems.” Pay close
    attention to how the Romans made concrete as well as how these
    engineering feats helped consolidate the Empire. Note that this
    reading also includes the topic outlined in subunit 1.2.2.    
        
     Reading and note-taking should take approximately 3 hours.

**1.2.2 Concrete and Roads** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit
1.2.1. In particular, focus on the “Roman Concrete” and “Roads and
Highways” sections.*

    Roads”](http://www.historytoday.com/logan-thompson/roman-roads) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read the entire article
    for a closer look at the massive road system that united the Empire.
    Pay close attention to the military and economic significance of
    this engineering feat.

    “The Pantheon Temple.” Watch this short film on the Pantheon. You
    may also click on the PDF icon to download a transcript of the
    podcast. Pay special attention to the creative use of concrete in
    the Pantheon’s construction. The building still stands in Rome and
    was an inspiration for the Panthéon in Paris, Thomas Jefferson
    Memorial in Washington DC, and numerous other structures around the
    world.
