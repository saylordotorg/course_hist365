**Unit 2: Eastern Transmissions** <span id="2"></span> 
*The Chinese printed with movable type well before Gutenberg’s press
(1450) and embarked on voyages of discovery well before Columbus (1492).
It is important to recover the global story behind major technological
developments such as these and to avoid heroic narratives that
simplistically attribute inventions to popularized individuals. Indeed,
multiple individuals working independently may claim the very same
invention – e.g. both Leibniz and Newton contended for calculus.*  
    
 *The decline of the Roman Empire in the West (Unit 1) meant that city
life and its structures fell into disrepair. The Christian world, which
was more strongly rooted in agriculture and spirituality than the Roman
world, showed less interest in Greco-Roman mathematics and philosophy
(“pagan” learning). It was rather the Arabic world, including the
Abbasid Dynasty, which preserved this intellectual and engineering
tradition. When Latin-speaking Christian authors began reconsidering the
pagan legacy (Unit 3), they often found that the teachings had been
translated into Arabic.*  
    
 *This unit introduces the technological achievements of ancient and
medieval China and discusses how the westward Mongol expansion
transferred Chinese technologies to Europe. You will then examine the
Arabic preservation of Greco-Roman ideas, particularly in the
disciplines of mathematics and alchemy. The link between centralized
state authority and technological advancement, which we witnessed in the
previous unit, is clear again in Chinese and Arabic history. These
Eastern influences became foundations for Western science and technology
in centuries to come.*
